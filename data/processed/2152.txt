intel unveils laser breakthrough intel said found way put silicon based laser chip raising hope much faster network scientist intel overcome fundamental problem prevented silicon used generate amplify laser light breakthrough make easier interconnect data network chip process information intel researcher said product exploiting breakthrough appear end decade overcome fundamental limit said dr mario paniccia director intel's photonics technology lab writing journal nature dr paniccia colleague haisheng rong richard jones ansheng liu oded cohen dani hak alexander fang show made continuous laser material used make computer processor currently say dr paniccia telecommunication equipment amplifies laser light travel fibre optic cable expensive exotic material gallium arsenide used make telecommunication firm chip maker would prefer use silicon light moving element cheap many problem using high volume manufacturing solved trying take silicon competency manufacturing apply new area said dr paniccia work done make component move light around silicon successfully used generate amplify laser light pulse used send data long distance despite fact silicon much better amplifier light pulse form material used fibre optic cable improved amplification due crystalline structure silicon used make computer chip dr paniccia said structure silicon meant laser light passed colliding photon rip electron atom within material creates cloud electron sitting silicon absorbs light said intel researcher found way suck away errant electron turn silicon material generate amplify laser light even better laser light produced way help easy make filter tuned across wide range frequency semi conductor laser made produced light narrow frequency range result could close integration fibre optic cable carry data light computer chip process dr paniccia said work one several step needed silicon used make component could carry process light form data pulse technical validation work said
